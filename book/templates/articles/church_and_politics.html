<p>
In this election year we reaffirm the policy of strict political neutrality for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Church does not endorse political candidates or parties in elections.
</p>
<p>
The Church does not advise its members how to vote.
</p>
<p>
Church facilities are not used for political purposes.
</p>
<p>
Church members should study the issues and candidates carefully and prayerfully and then vote for those they believe will act with integrity and will most nearly carry out their ideas of good government. Members are encouraged to participate as responsible citizens in supporting measures that strengthen society morally, economically, and culturally. They are urged to be actively engaged in worthy causes to improve their communities and make them more wholesome places in which to live and rear families.
</p>
<p>
Political candidates should not imply that their candidacy is endorsed by the Church or its leaders. Church directories or mailing lists should not be used for political purposes.
